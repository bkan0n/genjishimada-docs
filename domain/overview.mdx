# Domain Overview

The Genji platform orchestrates messaging, automation, and content extraction workflows across multiple services. Each service is scoped to a clear responsibility, while shared practices such as observability, deployment, and configuration management keep the system consistent.

## Architecture Snapshot
- **Bot**: Orchestrates interactions with external messaging platforms and routes user intents.
- **API**: Exposes HTTP interfaces for clients and internal consumers, including authentication and business logic.
- **Database**: Persists application and operational data with backups, migrations, and access policies.
- **RabbitMQ**: Coordinates asynchronous tasks, event fan-out, and reliable delivery between services.
- **OCR**: Extracts text and structured data from images or PDFs to power downstream automation.

## Operational Practices
- Centralized logging and tracing for cross-service diagnostics.
- Environment-specific configuration for development vs. production deployments.
- Health checks and readiness probes to keep rollouts safe.
