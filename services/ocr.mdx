# OCR Service

The OCR service extracts text and structured data from images and documents. It powers downstream automation and enrichment for user-generated content.

## Responsibilities
- Process images or PDFs and return machine-readable text.
- Support batch processing for high-volume ingestion.
- Expose health endpoints to validate model and worker readiness.

## Getting Started
1. Configure storage locations for input assets and output artifacts.
2. Tune model parameters or engine settings for target document types.
3. Monitor throughput and latency to scale workers proactively.
