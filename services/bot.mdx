# Bot Service

The bot service connects with messaging platforms to capture user intents and deliver responses. It handles inbound messages, session context, and routing to downstream services.

## Responsibilities
- Maintain connectors for supported messaging channels.
- Normalize incoming payloads and dispatch intents to the API service.
- Enforce rate limits and channel-level security requirements.

## Getting Started
1. Configure platform credentials and webhooks.
2. Set environment variables for development or production endpoints.
3. Deploy with monitoring enabled to trace message flows end-to-end.
