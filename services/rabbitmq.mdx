# RabbitMQ Service

RabbitMQ provides message brokering for asynchronous workflows. It enables decoupling between producers and consumers while enforcing delivery guarantees.

## Responsibilities
- Define exchanges, queues, and bindings that reflect business domains.
- Apply dead-lettering and retry policies for resilient processing.
- Monitor queue depth, consumer lag, and connection health.

## Getting Started
1. Provision vhosts and credentials for development and production.
2. Declare queues and exchanges at startup to keep topology consistent.
3. Enable TLS and authentication for all external connections.
