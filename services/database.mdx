# Database Service

The database layer stores application data, audit logs, and operational metrics. It supports migrations, backups, and strict access controls.

## Responsibilities
- Maintain schemas that support the API and bot services.
- Expose migrations and seeding routines per environment.
- Provide monitoring for replication, slow queries, and storage usage.

## Getting Started
1. Apply migrations before deploying dependent services.
2. Configure connection pooling and SSL for production workloads.
3. Set up automated backups and retention policies.
