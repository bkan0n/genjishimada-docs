# API Service

The API service exposes HTTP endpoints for client integrations and internal consumers. It includes authentication, request validation, and orchestration of downstream tasks via RabbitMQ and the database.

## Responsibilities
- Serve REST endpoints for core platform capabilities.
- Authenticate requests and apply authorization policies.
- Trigger asynchronous jobs and coordinate with the bot, OCR, and database services.

## Getting Started
1. Review the API overview for environment-specific base URLs.
2. Use the OpenAPI references to generate client SDKs.
3. Configure application secrets (JWT keys, database credentials) per environment.
