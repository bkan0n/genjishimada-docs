description: High-level summary of the Genji PK shared SDK library.
---

<Info>
The **Genji PK SDK** is a Python library that encapsulates common data models and utilities used by the API, bot, and any other Genji Parkour clients.  
Its primary goal is to ensure **type-safe, version-consistent** communication across services.
</Info>

## Purpose

- **Centralize data structures** for domain entities (users, maps, completions, etc.).
- **Avoid duplication** of request/response definitions across services.
- **Improve reliability** by using strong typing via `msgspec.Struct`.
- **Facilitate versioning** so API and clients stay in sync.

Without this SDK, each service would need to redefine the same Pydantic/Msgspec models, leading to inconsistencies and serialization bugs.

## Key features

- **Typed models for requests and responses** with snake_case attributes and a camelCase alias generator for JSON.
- **Domain enums** (e.g. `Difficulty`, `RankTier`, `SortOrder`) that map directly to accepted query parameters.
- **Conversion helpers** to serialize models to/from dictionaries and JSON.
- **Fast serialization** using [`msgspec`](https://github.com/jcrist/msgspec) instead of Pydantic where possible.
- **Consistency with the API** — models mirror the OpenAPI definitions in `genjishimada-api`, so the SDK automatically remains aligned when both repositories are updated.

## Installation

The SDK is packaged as a Python library. To install it locally:

```bash
# Using uv (preferred)
uv pip install -e .

# Or pip
pip install -e .
````

Once installed, you can import the models:

```python
from genjipk_sdk.users import UserResponse, UserUpdateRequest
from genjipk_sdk.maps import MapResponse
```

> There is no standalone CLI. The SDK is purely a Python library meant to be consumed by other services.

## Directory structure (high-level)

Each domain has its own module:

* `users/` — request/response models for user creation, updates, rank details, etc.
* `maps/` — models for maps, map mastery, difficulty, creators.
* `completions/` — responses for submissions, completions and ranking.
* `playtests/` — voting and playtest session models.
* `lootboxes/` — definitions of lootbox rewards and economy.
* `newsfeed/` — models for posts and comments.
* `notifications/` — event structures for asynchronous notifications.
* `utils/` — shared helpers (e.g. alias generator, ISO date parsing).

Depending on how the repository evolves, other modules may include **rank cards**, **XP progression**, **change requests**, etc.

## Patterns and best practices

* **One source of truth**: Do not manually replicate these structures in other services.
* **Keep models immutable**: The Msgspec structs are often frozen; avoid in-place mutation.
* **Use enums for query parameters**: They ensure only valid values are sent to the API.
* **Extend with caution**: When adding new fields, maintain backward compatibility and update the API accordingly.
